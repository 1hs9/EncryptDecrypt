# EncryptDecrypt
There exist two files encryption and decryption. The encryption file takes a string input and coverts them into binary and then further encodes it. Whereas the idea of decryption file is to take input of cipher-text and decode it further to reveal the plain text but as of now the decryption file is only able to convert the binary to the desired string value.
